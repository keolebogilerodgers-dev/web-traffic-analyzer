# Web Traffic Analytics Dashboard

A Python-based application that processes web server logs and generates interactive HTML dashboards for monitoring traffic patterns, status codes, and endpoint popularity.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Backend**: Python application for log processing and data analysis
- **Frontend**: Static HTML dashboards with data visualization
- **Development**: Used Jupyter notebooks (`etc/jupyter/`) for data exploration
- **Environment**: Managed dependencies with Python virtual environments

## 🔥 Machine Learning Integration

I've enhanced this project with **machine learning anomaly detection** using Isolation Forest algorithm.

### 🚀 New Features:
- **ML-powered anomaly detection** - identifies unusual traffic patterns
- **Interactive dashboard** - visualizes anomalies in real traffic data
- **Automated reporting** - generates detailed analysis reports

### 📊 View the ML Analysis:
- [Interactive ML Dashboard](traffic_ml_dashboard.html) - Visual anomaly detection
- [Full ML Analysis Report](ml_traffic_report.md) - Detailed findings

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation:
- **Algorithm**: Isolation Forest (unsupervised learning)
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Features**: Hourly request counts
- **Accuracy**: 94.6% normal traffic identified
- **Anomalies Detected**: 9/168 hours (5.4%)

### 🎯 Business Impact:
This ML enhancement transforms raw logs into actionable insights, helping identify potential DDoS attacks, infrastructure issues, and traffic patterns.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

This project, developed during my transition into software development, provided hands-on experience with:

| Skill Category | Specific Skills |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Full-Stack Development** | Building complete applications with backend processing and frontend presentation |
| **Data Processing** | Parsing, analyzing, and visualizing structured log data |

## 🔗 Connection to Current Focus

This project represents **foundational work in application development** that directly informed my current specialization in **C# and .NET**. The core concepts learned here—data processing, web application architecture, and creating maintainable software—are now being applied to building scalable .NET Web APIs and system architectures.
