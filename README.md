# Web Traffic Analytics Dashboard

A Python-based application that processes web server logs and generates interactive HTML dashboards for monitoring traffic patterns, status codes, and endpoint popularity.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Backend**: Python application for log processing and data analysis
- **Frontend**: Static HTML dashboards with data visualization
- **Development**: Used Jupyter notebooks (`etc/jupyter/`) for data exploration
- **Environment**: Managed dependencies with Python virtual environments

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

This project, developed during my transition into software development, provided hands-on experience with:

| Skill Category | Specific Skills |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Full-Stack Development** | Building complete applications with backend processing and frontend presentation |
| **Data Processing** | Parsing, analyzing, and visualizing structured log data |
| **Problem-Solving** | Creating a practical tool to monitor and understand web application behavior |
| **Software Engineering Practices** | Dependency management, logging, and organized project structure |

## 🔗 Connection to Current Focus

This project represents **foundational work in application development** that directly informed my current specialization in **C# and .NET**. The core concepts learned here—data processing, web application architecture, and creating maintainable software—are now being applied to building scalable .NET Web APIs and system architectures.
